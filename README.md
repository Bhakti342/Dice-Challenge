# Dice Game

This is a simple dice game where two dice are rolled each time the page is reloaded, and the higher value dice wins! It's a fun and easy game to play, and there's no installation required.

## How It Works
- Each time you reload the page, two dice will randomly roll.
- The dice with the higher number is declared the winner.
- If both dice roll the same number, it's a draw.

## How to Play
- Clone the repository first from GitHub:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Bhakti342/Dice-Challenge.git
  cd Dice-Challenge
  ```
- Simply double-click the index.html file.
- The game will open in your web browser.
- Reload the page (or press F5) to roll the dice again!
